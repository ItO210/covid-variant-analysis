# Computational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variants

A R project that analyzes nucleotide mutations across three variants of SARS-CoV-2: the original strain, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), and the Omicron variant (BA.5). This project provides insights into the mutational evolution of the virus using bioinformatics tools and sequence data.

This project was developed in **October 2022**.

## Features

- **Variant Comparison**: Compares the nucleotide sequences of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, Delta variant, and Omicron variant.
- **Mutation Identification**: Identifies and analyzes nucleotide mutations between the variants.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks mutation frequencies across the variants and visualizes the data.
- **Protein-Coding Sequence Analysis**: Focuses on the mutational impact on protein-coding regions of the virus.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs and charts showing mutation frequencies and their distribution.
- **Sequence Data Handling**: Uses bioinformatics tools like seqinr, dplyr, and ggplot2 for data analysis and visualization.

## Report Generation

The analysis.pdf file is the final report generated from analysis.rmd using R Markdown. The .rmd file contains the code and methodology used for the analysis, which can be re-run or modified to generate updated results.
